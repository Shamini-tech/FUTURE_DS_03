Marketing Funnel & Conversion Performance Analysis – Task 3
Overview

This project analyzes a marketing funnel to understand how users move from initial contact to final conversion. The goal is to identify drop-off points, evaluate channel effectiveness, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve conversion rates.

This work was completed as Task 3 (2026) under the Future Interns – Data Science & Analytics Program.

Objective

Analyze the marketing funnel stages (Visitors → Leads → Customers)

Measure conversion rates at each stage

Identify where maximum drop-offs occur

Compare performance across marketing channels and time periods

Provide actionable recommendations to improve conversions

Dataset

Bank Marketing Campaign Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

Real-world data from direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution

Target variable: y (whether the client subscribed to a term deposit)

Dataset size: ~41,000 records

Tools & Technologies

Python

Google Colab

Pandas (data manipulation)

Matplotlib (visualization)

Funnel Definition

Visitors: All contacted customers

Leads: Customers with call duration > 0

Customers: Customers who subscribed to the term deposit (y = 'yes')

Key Analysis Performed

Visitor → Lead conversion rate

Lead → Customer conversion rate

Funnel drop-off analysis

Channel-wise conversion performance (contact)

Time-based conversion trends (monthly)

Key Insights

The largest drop-off occurs between Leads and Customers

Certain contact channels consistently outperform others in conversion

Conversion rates show noticeable variation across months, indicating seasonality

Improving lead nurturing has higher impact than increasing raw outreach volume

Recommendations

Focus optimization efforts on the Lead → Customer stage

Reallocate resources toward high-performing contact channels

Time campaigns during higher-converting months

Improve targeting to reduce low-intent leads

Outcome

This project demonstrates how marketing funnel analysis can be used to translate raw campaign data into clear business insights and revenue-focused decisions.
